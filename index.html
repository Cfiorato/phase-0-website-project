                <p>
                    Cameron Fiorato is a mid-western sweetheart. Known for his enthusiasm for McChickens and 
                    The Cat in The Hat movie with Mike Meyers, Cameron attacks every day with a positive attitude
                    and a little bit of fun! Cameron is currently studying Software Engineering through FlatIron
                    School and has put this site together so everyone who works with him knows a little bit more 
                    about him!
